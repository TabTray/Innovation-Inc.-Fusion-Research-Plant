"what if we take all the content"

This is a repository dedicated to allowing people to create their own games without the hell we went through!
feel free to steal our shit without a care in the world, *i* have to go the the room made entirely of glass and pick up 15 acres of broken lua. by myself.
This will include doors, UI, or just random props for you to use!
